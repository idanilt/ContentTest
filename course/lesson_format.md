### Step 1: Power the Core

Plug the included USB cable into the Spark Core and your computer. The Core should start blinking blue.  [Have one of these u.FL connectors?](/hardware#spark-core-datasheet-types-of-cores) Make sure you connect an antenna to it now!

- Not blinking blue?
  - Maybe it's already been configured. Hold down the MODE button until it starts blinking blue, then continue.
