# MAKEREE

### What is Makeree ?

Makeree is an app-course that will teach you how to become a maker. It’s amazingly fun, rewarding and FREE.

We have chopped the learning curriculum to become a maker to small but “proudable” projects. Each project is a step in your journey to become a maker. Finishing a project and taking a picture of it allows you to get feedback from experts and from peers, who just finished this same project a couple of days ago.

Our step by step instructions (with stunning images) helps you to build amazing projects and learn a thing or two on the way. You will start with simple projects like a homemade electromagnet or a homopolar motor and move on to more complicated ones like a robotic arm or a laser spirograph. Learn by doing! it’s the best way, especially if you have a digital mentor like Makeree. 

Follow your Path, Discover new skills and new friends.

Don’t stop making!
